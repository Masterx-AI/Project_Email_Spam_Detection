# Project_Email_Spam_Detection ðŸ“§

### Description:

The "spam" concept is diverse: advertisements for products/web sites, make money fast schemes, chain letters, pornography...

Our collection of spam e-mails came from our postmaster and individuals who had filed spam. Our collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of non-spam. These are useful when constructing a personalized spam filter. One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general purpose spam filter.

The dataset, taken from the UCI ML repository, contains about 4600 emails labelled as **spam** or **ham**. 

The dataset can be downloaded here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase

### Objective:
- Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
- Build classification models to predict whether or not the email spam.
- Compare the evaluation metrics of vaious classification algorithms.

### The Project is divided into the following steps:
1. Data Exploration
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Feature Selection/Extraction
5. Feature Scaling
6. Predictive Modeling
7. Project Outcomes & Conclusions
